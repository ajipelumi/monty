int main(int ac, char *av)
{
	open file

		while (their is a line in the file)
		{
			get the current line
				get the opcode in the line using strtok
				if the line is empty, continue
				else if the opcode is wrong, print appropriate error and exit
					copy the current line to a variable (curLine)
						the variable should be a globa variable
						call the appropriate function
		}
}

void push(stack_t *stack, unsigned int lineNo)
{
	remember that global variable? curLine
		use strtok to get the argument in curLine
		if the argument is not an int, print error
			if it has no argument, print error

				convert argument to int
					push the int to the stack.
					free curLine and set it to null
}
